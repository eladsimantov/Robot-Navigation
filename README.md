# Robot-Navigation
This repository includes the final project for the course Robot Navigation 036044 in ME at the Technion.

## Part 1
Main filename:  Part1.m     
Part 1 of the project is to find the C space boundary of multiple obstacles based on a given robot in 2D.   
The results are all given in the Part 1 report.

## Part 2
Main filename:  Part2.m     
In the second part of the project we created a grid and planned a robot navigation from start to a target (position and orientation)    
while avoiding the obstacles according to the "Bed_Movers_Problem.pdf".     
We used BFS, DFS and A* and compared their performance.
